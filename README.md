<i>HTML Overview:</i>

DOCTYPE and meta tags: These foundational elements ensure the document adheres to the latest web standards and that it adjusts appropriately to varying device sizes, ensuring mobile-friendliness.

header: This section forms the backbone of the site's navigation. Embedded within are logo images and navigational links, optimized for intuitive user flow.

section: Each 'section' tag demarcates distinct content areas, from showcasing products to explaining delivery methods. This aids in the logical organization of content.

img: A vital tag that enhances user experience with visual representations, be it the brand's identity via the logo or the tantalizing allure of the ice cream products.

a: These are clickable elements, directing users either within the site or externally. The project heavily relies on these for navigation and social media engagement.

CSS Overview:
General Styling: By using the universal (*) selector, the website begins with a clean slate, eliminating browser-specific default styles. The ':root' pseudo-class defines color schemes, creating a consistent visual theme.

Flexbox: This modern layout model ensures content scales gracefully. Whether it's aligning products in a grid or centering text, Flexbox is pivotal in the site's adaptability.

Media Queries: A responsive design cornerstone. Depending on device dimensions, these queries adjust elements for optimal viewing, from desktops to smartphones.

Pseudo-elements and classes: These extend design capabilities, adding nuanced touches like hover effects or active states for clickable elements.

Animation: Visual feedback, like the subtle movement of the ice cream image on the homepage, is achieved through CSS animations. This not only grabs attention but enhances user interaction.
